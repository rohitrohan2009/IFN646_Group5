# Sleep-Wake Classification Comparison: Actiwatch vs. Apple Watch
## IFN646 Biomedical Data Science - Group 5

This GitHub repository is dedicated to the project report of Group 5 from the QUT course "Biomedical Data Science." In this project, we explore the comparison of sleep/wake classification using accelerometry data collected
from both Apple Watch and Actiwatch wearable devices. The dataset used for this analysis comprises 27 nights of actigraphy data, which is available in CSV format within the 'raw_data' folder.
